# An-Embedded-Wearable-Suit-for-Soldier-Safety
Our Indian army is the fourth largest and well organized and influential compared to other countries in the world. This is possible only when the life of each soldier is safeguarded. Even though technologies grow, the lack of communication and information unavailability during a conflict on the battle field increases the soldier's death rate.In our project, we are presenting an Embedded Wearable Suit for Soldier which monitor the health, physical and environmental parameters of the  Soldier. In this real time health monitoring system, communication links are provided by a LoRa network infrastructure instead of cellular networks, since, they are either absent or doesnâ€™t allow data transmission in warzone or remote areas. Moreover, a camera module and Emergency button is provided to monitor any emergency situation in the Warzone.
